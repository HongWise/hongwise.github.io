## Inline code

Wrap inline snippets of code with `<code>`. Be sure to escape HTML angle brackets.

## Code blocks

Use `<pre>`s for multiple lines of code. Once again, be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering. You may optionally add the `.pre-scrollable` class, which will set a max-height of 340px and provide a y-axis scrollbar.

## Variables

For indicating variables use the `<var>` tag.

## User input

Use the `<kbd>` to indicate input that is typically entered via keyboard.

## Sample output

For indicating sample output from a program use the `<samp>` tag.
