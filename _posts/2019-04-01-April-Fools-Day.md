**April Fools' Day** or **April Fool's Day** (sometimes called **All Fools' Day**) is an annual celebration on April 1, commemorated by [practical jokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) and hoaxes. The player(s) of the joke(s) or hoax(es) often exposes their action by shouting "**April fool(s)**" at the recipient(s). The recipient of these actions are called **April fools**. Mass media can be involved in these pranks that the following day are reported as such. Although popular since the 19th century, the day is not a [public holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday) in any country.
