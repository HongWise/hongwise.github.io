title: International Women's Day

**International Women's Day (IWD)** is celebrated on March 8 every year [3]. It is a focal point in the movement for [women's rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights).

After the [Socialist Party of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America) organized a Women's Day on February 28, 1909, in New York. At the 1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference suggested German revolutionary Clara Zetkin proposed that 8 March be honored as a day annually in memory of working women.[4][5] The day has been celebrated as International Women's Day or International Working Women's Day ever since.[4] For women at that meeting, the day was about demanding the right to work without discrimination. After women gained suffrage in Soviet Russia in 1917, March 8 became a national holiday there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted by the feminist movement in about 1967. The United Nations began celebrating the day in 1975.[6]

Commemoration of International Women's Day today ranges from being a public holiday in some countries to being largely ignored elsewhere.[7] In some places where women have less rights, it is a day of protest; in others where women have more opportunities, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.[8]
